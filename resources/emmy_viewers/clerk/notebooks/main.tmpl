;; Hello! This project was generated by the [`emmy-viewers/clerk`
;; template](https://emmy-viewers.mentat.org/#project-template). The template
;; comes with everything you need you everything you need to

;; - Interactively develop Clerk notebooks
;; - Publish them to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or [Clerk's Garden](https://github.clerk.garden/)
;; - Use a [custom ClojureScript build](https://clerk-utils.mentat.org/#custom-clojurescript-builds) in both modes

;; Some good next steps:

;; - Visit this project's README.md for guides on how to proceed.
;; - Read the [`Emmy-Viewers` documentation notebook](https://emmy-viewers.mentat.org)
;; - Read the [Book of Clerk](https://book.clerk.vision/)
;; - Visit the [Awesome-Clerk](https://github.com/mentat-collective/awesome-clerk) list for ideas
;; - Delete anything in this notebook you feel like you don't need.

;; ## Clerk Environment Basics
;;
;; Here's a basic use of Clerk. This is a function:

(defn hello [s]
  (str "Hello, " s "!"))

;; If we call this function, Clerk will render the form and its output:

(hello "Clerk")

;; - The form `(hello "Clerk")` executes in the JVM.
;; - The resulting string "Hello, Clerk!" is serialized over a WebSocket to the
;;   browser, where Clerk's ClojureScript side renders it using a
;;   pre-registered "viewer".
;; - These viewers are written in code evaluated using the [Small Clojure
;;   Interpreter](https://github.com/babashka/sci), or "SCI".

;; Clerk comes with [many viewers](https://book.clerk.vision/#viewers), and
;; gives us the ability to [write _new_
;; viewers](https://book.clerk.vision/#writing-viewers) using a default SCI
;; environment that Clerk makes available to us.
