implementation of numerical derivatives. The\n;; final function, `D-numeric`, uses Richardson extrapolation to speed up\n;; convergence of successively tighter estimates of $f^{\\prime}(x)$ using a few\n;; different methods.\n;;\n;; The inspiration for this style was Sussman's \"Abstraction in Numerical\n;; Methods\", starting on page 10:\n;; https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/6060/AIM-997.pdf?sequence=2\n;;\n;; We'll proceed by deriving the methods symbolically, and then implement them\n;; numerically.\n;;\n;; First, a function that will print nicely rendered infix versions\n;; of (simplified) symbolic expressions:\n\n(defn- show [e]\n  (->infix (g/simplify e)))\n\n;; And a function to play with:\n\n(def ^:private func\n  (af/literal-function 'f))\n\n;; ## Approximating Derivatives with Taylor Series\n;;\n;; The key to all of these methods involves the taylor series expansion of an\n;; arbitrary function $f$ around a point $x$; we know the taylor series will\n;; include a term for $f^{\\prime}(x)$, so the goal is to see if we can isolate\n;; it.\n\n;; Here's the taylor series expansions of $f(x + h)$:\n\n(def ^:private fx+h\n  (-> ((d/taylor-series func 'x) 'h)\n      (series/sum 4)))\n\n;; Use `show` to print out its infix representation:\n\n(comment\n  (show fx+h))\n;; => \"1/24 h\u2074 D\u2074f(x) + 1/6 h\u00b3 D\u00b3f(x) + 1/2 h\u00b2 D\u00b2f(x) + h Df(x) + f(x)\"\n\n;; We can solve this for $Df(x)$ by subtracting $f(x)$ and dividing out $h$:\n\n(comment\n  (show (g// (g/- fx+h (func 'x)) 'h)))\n\n;; => \"1/24 h\u00b3 D\u2074f(x) + 1/6 h\u00b2 D\u00b3f(x) + 1/2 h D\u00b2f(x) + Df(x)\"\n;;\n;; Voila! The remaining terms include $D f(x)$ along with a series of\n;; progressively-smaller \"error terms\" (since $h \\to 0$). The first of these\n;; terms is ${1 \\over 2} h D^2 f(x)$. It will come to dominate the error as $h\n;; \\to 0$, so we say that the approximation we've just derived has error of\n;; $O(h)$.\n;;\n;; This particular formula, in the limit as $h \\to 0$, is called the \"forward\n;; difference approximation\" to $Df(x)$. Here's the Clojure implementation:\n\n(defn forward-difference\n  \"Returns a single-variable function of a step size `h` that calculates the\n  forward-difference estimate of the the first derivative of `f` at point `x`:\n\n  ```\n  f'(x) = [f(x + h) - f(x)] / h\n  ```\n\n  Optionally accepts a third argument `fx == (f x)`, in case you've already\n  calculated it elsewhere and would like to save a function evaluation.\"\n  ([f x] (forward-difference f x (f x)))\n  ([f x fx]\n   (fn [h]\n     (/ (- (f (+ x h)) fx) h))))\n\n;; We could also expand $f(x - h)$:\n\n(def ^:private fx-h\n  (-> ((d/taylor-series func 'x) (g/negate 'h))\n      (series/sum 4)))\n\n(comment\n  (show fx-h))\n;; => \"1/24 h\u2074 D\u2074f(x) -1/6 h\u00b3 D\u00b3f(x) + 1/2 h\u00b2 D\u00b2f(x) - h Df(x) + f(x)\"\n\n;; and solve for $Df(x)$:\n\n(comment\n  (show (g// (g/- (func 'x) fx-h) 'h)))\n;; => \"-1/24 h\u00b3 D\u2074f(x) + 1/6 h\u00b2 D\u00b3f(x) -1/2 h D\u00b2f(x) + Df(x)\"\n;;\n;; To get a similar method, called the \"backward difference\" formula.

From Sussman: \"Any real number $x$,\n;; represented in the machine, is rounded to a value $x(1 + e)$, where $e$ is\n;; effectively a random variable whose absolute value is on the order of the\n;; machine epsilon $\\epsilon$: that smallest positive number for which 1.0 and\n;; $1.0 + \\epsilon$ can be distinguished.\"\n;;\n;;\n;; In the current library, `v/machine-epsilon` holds this value.\n;;\n;; Our goal, then, is to see if we can figure out when the error due to roundoff\n;; grows so large that it exceeds the tolerance we want to apply to our\n;; calculation.\n;;\n;; For the central difference formula:\n;;\n;; $$f^{\\prime}(x) = {f(x + h) - f(x - h)} \\over {2h}$$\n;;\n;; without any roundoff error, the numerator /should/ be equal to $2h f'(x)$. In\n;; reality, for small values of $h$, $f(x + h)$ and $f(x - h)$ both have machine\n;; representations in error by about $f(x) \\epsilon$. Their difference doesn't\n;; change the order, so we can say that their difference also has error of $f(x)\n;; \\epsilon$.\n;;\n;; Dividing these two together, the relative error is:\n;;\n;; $$\\epsilon\\left|\\frac{f(x)}{2 h f^{\\prime}(x)}\\right|$$\n;;\n;; The relative error doubles each time $h$ is halved. This is technically just\n;; the relative error of the numerator of the central difference method, but we\n;; know the denominator $2h$ to full precision, so we can ignore it here.\n;;\n;; If we actually calculate this ratio, we'll find the INITIAL relative error\n;; due to roundoff for a given h. Also, because we want to make sure that we're\n;; working in integer multiples of machine epsilon, let's actually take the\n;; next-highest-integer of the ratio above. The following method takes the ratio\n;; above as an argument, and returns:\n;;\n;; $$1 + floor(\\lvert ratio \\rvert)$$\n\n(defn- roundoff-units\n  \"Returns the number of 'roundoff units', ie, multiples of the machine epsilon,\n  that roundoff error contributes to the total relative error, given a relative\n  error percentage estimated for some initial step size $h$.\"\n  [rel-error-ratio]\n  (inc\n   (Math/floor\n    (Math/abs\n     (double rel-error-ratio)))))\n\n;; That calculation, as the documentation states, returns the number\n;; of \"roundoff units\".
