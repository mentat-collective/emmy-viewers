consequence function (see `sicmutils.consequence`)\n;;\n;; - the matcher (and its predicate) determine whether or not the rule applies\n;;   to its data input, and\n;; - The consequence can either fail, or successfully return some arbitrary\n;;   value or transformation of the bindings from the successful match\n;;\n;; The final rule is a function from a data input to either failure or a\n;; successful transformation.\n;;\n;; This namespace defines:\n;;\n;; - the machinery required to create rules, in both function and macro form\n;; - some basic rules\n;; - combinators to build more advanced rules and term rewriting systems out of\n;;   basic rules.
