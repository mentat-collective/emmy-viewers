;; ## Oscillator Communication btw Server, Client
;;
;; This was a fun thing I thought would never work, but whipped up yesterday.
;; Consider this a copy-paste clone of `oscillator.clj`.
;;
;; We have a Lagrangian:

(defn L-harmonic-gravity [m k g]
  (fn [[_ [_ _ z :as q] v]]
    (let [T (* 1/2 m (square v))
          U (+ (* 1/2 k (square q))
               (* g m z))]
      (- T U))))

;; And some settings:

(def m 100)
(def k 200)
(def g 9.8)

;; Here's the initial state of our simulation.

(def init-state
  {:state->xyz coordinate
   :L (L-harmonic-gravity m k g)
   :initial-state [0
                   [1 2 0]
                   [2 0 4]]
   :cartesian
   {:range [[-10, 10]
            [-10, 10]
            [-10, 10]]
    :scale [3 3 3]}})

;; Now we have the `interactive-physics-viewer`, which has a nice surprise for
;; us.

^{::clerk/viewer (pv/interactive-physics-viewer
                  'mb/oscillator-demo
                  (pv/physics-xform-fn init-state))}
(defonce oscillator-state
  (atom init-state))

;; Here's the state of the atom. Note that this will refresh every time the atom
;; changes server-side. And the viewer above can do that!
;;
;; Every time the ODE solver updates the state on the browser side, the new
;; state is sent back over the wire to the server.

@oscillator-state

;; Then, the simulation:

^{::clerk/visibility :hide}
(clerk/with-viewer d/multiviewer
  (let [L (L-harmonic-gravity 'm 'k 'g)
        x (e/literal-function 'x)
        y (e/literal-function 'y)
        z (e/literal-function 'z)]
    (((e/Lagrange-equations L) (up x y z))
     't)))
